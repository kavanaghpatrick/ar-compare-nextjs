### Basic Integration - Individual Components

```tsx

  ProductComparison, 
  PurchaseRecommendations, 
  MarketContext, 
  SimilarProducts 
} from '@/components';

// In your product detail page
function ProductDetailPage({ product, allProducts }) {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Existing product header content */}
      
      {/* Enhanced comparison features */}
      <ProductComparison 
        currentProduct={product}
        allProducts={allProducts}
      />
      
      <PurchaseRecommendations 
        product={product}
        allProducts={allProducts}
      />
      
      <MarketContext 
        product={product}
        allProducts={allProducts}
      />
      
      <SimilarProducts 
        currentProduct={product}
        allProducts={allProducts}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Advanced Integration - Tabbed Interface

```tsx
import { ProductDetailsEnhanced } from '@/components/ProductDetailsEnhanced';

function ProductDetailPage({ product, allProducts }) {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Existing product header content */}
      
      {/* Enhanced tabbed interface */}
      <ProductDetailsEnhanced 
        product={product}
        allProducts={allProducts}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Integration with Existing Product Page

Update your existing product page (`app/products/[id]/page.tsx`):

```tsx
import { 
  ProductComparison, 
  PurchaseRecommendations, 
  MarketContext, 
  SimilarProducts 
} from '@/components';

// Add to your existing ProductDetailPage component
// After the ProductTabsClient component:

{/* Enhanced Analysis Section */}
<div className="enhanced-analysis-section">
  <ProductComparison 
    currentProduct={product}
    allProducts={allProducts}
  />
  
  <PurchaseRecommendations 
    product={product}
    allProducts={allProducts}
  />
  
  <MarketContext 
    product={product}
    allProducts={allProducts}
  />
  
  <SimilarProducts 
    currentProduct={product}
    allProducts={allProducts}
  />
</div>
```

## Required Data Structure

All components work with the existing `EnhancedProduct` type, which includes:

- `marketContext`: Target audience, use cases, competitive advantage, price positioning
- `purchaseRecommendation`: Best for scenarios, avoid if conditions, alternatives
- `customerInsights`: Top pros/cons, overall sentiment
- `amazon`: Pricing, availability, ratings from Amazon
- All existing product specifications and features

## Styling

All components use the existing design system:
- Dark theme with glassmorphism effects
- Consistent blue accent colors
- Mobile-responsive grid layouts
- Accessible focus states
- Smooth animations and transitions

The CSS is already included in `globals.css` with comprehensive responsive breakpoints.

## Features Highlights

### Interactive Elements
- Expandable sections for detailed information
- Carousel navigation for product recommendations
- Tabbed interfaces for different analysis views
- Clickable similarity indicators and match scores

### Comparison Intelligence
- Performance-based color coding (green=better, red=worse, yellow=equal)
- Smart similarity algorithms based on specs, price, and use cases
- Dynamic user profile matching with percentage scores
- Real-time price and value analysis

### Purchase Decision Support
- Contextual recommendations based on user types
- Budget-aware alternative suggestions
- Market timing advice (pre-order warnings, discount alerts)
- Cross-brand competitive analysis

### Mobile Optimization
- Responsive grid layouts that collapse to single columns
- Touch-friendly carousel controls

## Best Practices

1. **Performance**: Components are optimized with useMemo for expensive calculations
2. **Accessibility**: All interactive elements have proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks when similar products aren't found
4. **Data Validation**: Components handle missing or incomplete product data
5. **SEO**: Semantic HTML structure with proper heading hierarchy
