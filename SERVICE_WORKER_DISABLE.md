# Service Worker Disable Guide

This guide explains how the service worker has been temporarily disabled for troubleshooting purposes.

## What Was Done

### 1. Service Worker Registration Blocked
- Created `ServiceWorkerManager` component that prevents service worker registration
- Added environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SERVICE_WORKER=false` to disable service workers
- Added immediate cleanup script `/disable-sw.js` that runs before React loads

### 2. Service Worker File Modified
- Modified `/public/sw.js` to immediately unregister itself
- Commented out all caching logic
- Service worker now does nothing and unregisters itself on activation

### 3. Cache Cleanup
- All existing caches are cleared automatically
- Service worker manager cleans up any existing registrations

### 4. Testing Tools Created
- `/sw-test` - Quick test page to verify service worker is disabled
- `/sw-manager` - Full management interface for service workers and caches
- `/test-no-sw.html` - Static HTML page for unregistering service workers

## How to Test

1. **Quick Test**: Visit `/sw-test` to see current status
2. **Full Management**: Visit `/sw-manager` for detailed control
3. **Browser DevTools**: 
   - Open DevTools → Application → Service Workers
   - Should show no active service workers
   - Storage → Cache Storage should be empty

## To Re-enable Service Worker

1. Set environment variable: `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SERVICE_WORKER=true`
2. Restore original service worker code to `/public/sw.js`
3. Remove or comment out the `<script src="/disable-sw.js"></script>` line in layout.tsx
4. Restart the development server

## Files Modified

- `/components/ServiceWorkerManager.tsx` - New component for managing service workers
- `/app/layout.tsx` - Added service worker manager and disable script
- `/public/sw.js` - Modified to disable itself
- `/public/disable-sw.js` - Immediate cleanup script
- `/.env.local` - Added environment variable
- `/app/sw-manager/page.tsx` - Management interface
- `/app/sw-test/page.tsx` - Quick test page

## Current Status

✅ Service Worker is **DISABLED**
✅ All caches are **CLEARED**
✅ No new registrations will occur
✅ Existing registrations are automatically removed

The service worker is now completely disabled and should not interfere with resource loading or caching.
